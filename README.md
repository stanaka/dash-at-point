# Overview

dash-at-point.el --- Search the word at point with Dash

[Dash](http://kapeli.com/) is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. dash-at-point make it easy to search the word at point with Dash.

# Usage

If you choose not to use one of the convenient packages in
[Melpa][melpa], you will need to add the directory containing
`dash-at-point.el` to your `load-path`, and then add the following to
your .emacs:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dash-at-point")
(autoload 'dash-at-point "dash-at-point"
          "Search the word at point with Dash." t nil)
(global-set-key "\C-cd" 'dash-at-point)
(global-set-key "\C-ce" 'dash-at-point-with-docset)
```

Run `dash-at-point` to search the word at point, then Dash is launched and search the word. Use prefix argument `C-u` to edit the search string first.

Dash queries can be narrowed down with a docset prefix. You can customize the relations between docsets and major modes.

```lisp
(add-to-list 'dash-at-point-mode-alist '(perl-mode . "perl"))
```

To choose docsets before call Dash, run `dash-at-point-with-docset`. If you have Dash 3.0+ installed, the options are suggested from the function `dash-at-point-installed-docsets`. Otherwise, the options are suggested from the variable `dash-at-point-docsets`.

Additionally, the buffer-local variable `dash-at-point-docset` can
be set in a specific mode hook (or file/directory local variables)
to programmatically override the guessed docset.  For example:

```lisp
(add-hook 'rinari-minor-mode-hook
          (lambda () (setq dash-at-point-docset "rails")))
```

Dash 1.9.3 introduces a new way to call Dash with keywords (`dash-plugin://`), but if you want to use the legacy way (`dash://`), set non-nil to `dash-at-point-legacy-mode`.

```lisp
(custom-set-variables '(dash-at-point-legacy-mode t))
```
