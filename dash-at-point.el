;; Dash ( http://kapeli.com/ ) is an API Documentation Browser and
;; Code Snippet Manager. dash-at-point make it easy to search the word
;; at point with Dash.
;;
;; Add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dash-at-point")
;;   (autoload 'dash-at-point "dash-at-point"
;;             "Search the word at point with Dash." t nil)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cd" 'dash-at-point)
;;
;; Run `dash-at-point' to search the word at point, then Dash is
;; launched and search the word.
;;
;; Dash queries can be narrowed down with a docset prefix. You can
;; customize the relations between docsets and major modes.
