;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Dash ( http://kapeli.com/ ) is an API Documentation Browser and
;; Code Snippet Manager.  dash-at-point make it easy to search the word
;; at point with Dash.
;;
;; Add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/dash-at-point")
;;   (autoload 'dash-at-point "dash-at-point"
;;             "Search the word at point with Dash." t nil)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cd" 'dash-at-point)
;;
;; Run `dash-at-point' to search the word at point, then Dash is
;; launched and search the word. To edit the search term first,
;; use C-u to set the prefix argument for `dash-at-point'.
;;
;; Dash queries can be narrowed down with a docset prefix.  You can
;; customize the relations between docsets and major modes.
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'dash-at-point-mode-alist '(perl-mode . "perl"))
;;
;; Additionally, the buffer-local variable `dash-at-point-docset' can
;; be set in a specific mode hook (or file/directory local variables)
;; to programmatically override the guessed docset.  For example:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'rinari-minor-mode-hook
;;             (lambda () (setq dash-at-point-docset "rails")))

;;; Code:

;;;###autoload

For example, Ruby on Rails programmers might add an \"allruby\"
tag to the Rails, Ruby and Rubygems docsets in Dash, and then add

which sets this variable to \"allruby\" so that Dash will search
